My name is Michael McFarland and I'm currently learning how to code as a hobby and to broaden my skillset as an IT professional. I'm specifically interested in learning more about automation and app development. I'm excited to get started on this journey and seeing just how far I can go with these new skills. I'll be mostly "self" taught through free online resources with a goal of learning Java, Python, and Rust! I'll be fine tuning this README over time and adding projects as I learn. Thanks for stopping by my profile!
